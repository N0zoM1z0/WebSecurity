DESCRIPTION
DC-3 is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.

As with the previous DC releases, this one is designed with beginners in mind, although this time around, there is only one flag, one entry point and no clues at all.

Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.

**环境搭建**
出了点小问题...
IDE 设备 (磁盘/CD-ROM)配置不正确。“ide0:1”上具有一个 IDE 从设备，但没有主设备。此配置在虚拟机中无法正常运行。请使用配置编辑器将磁盘/CD-ROM 从“ide0:1”移到“ide0:0”。
